# Prerequisites

## PostgreSQL >= 10

## Elixir >= 1.10

[Erlang Solutions](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/) provides packages and binaries for download.

You'll need the following packages:

    erlang-base erlang-dev erlang-parsetools erlang-xmerl elixir

## RabbitMQ

## NodeJS (14.*.*)

## Features

- Headless 
- GraphQL API 
- Fine grained permission system for users organised in Organisatons (Orgs)
- Authentication using HTTP Basic Auth or JWT (to use external identity and auth system).
- Stores campaign tree (action pages organised in campaigns, where different Orgs can run a coalition)
- Stores actions and member personal data, personal data is E2E encrypted at rest. Only the Org that is data controller can decrypt it.
- Validates personal data types using various personal data schemas (email+postcode, European Citizen Initaitive, and so on)
- Handles GDPR consent (with optional double opt-in), and action staging (moderation, filtering before it is accepted)
- Sends emails (thank you emails, opt in emails, emails-to-targets) through various mail backends (Mailjet, AWS SES, more coming)
- Pluggable action processing on RabbitMQ queue 
- Forward actions to AWS SQS, CRMs (needs a decrypting gateway proxy at Org premises)
- Export action data in CSV

# Development setup

The script utils/configure-development-environment.sh will setup PostgreSQL, the Erlang / Elixir / Pheonix server, the RabbitMQ server and runs npm install in the assets directory.

The script needs a few ENV varaibles set:

`$ export ADMIN_EMAIL=you@example.com MIX_ENV=dev ORGANIZATION='fix-the-status-quo'`

You'll need sudo to run the parts of the script that configure PostgreSQL.

`$ ./utils/configure-development-environment.sh`

The seeds.exs command will print out your login and password:

    #####
    #####   Created Admin user email@example.com  #####
    #####   Password: VERY_RANDOM_PASSWORD
    #####

You can then run the development server.

`$ mix phx.server`

By default, the development webserver is located at http://localhost:4000/

# Configuration

See config/config.exs and config/dev.exs for configuration options.
